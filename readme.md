### Technologies Used
- vanilla javscript
- jquery
- html: svgs created in illustrator
- css: custom css with flexbox for layouts

### Approach Taken

I took a very step-by-step process with this project. My first goal was to get a minimally-viable game up and running. THIS MVG was simply matching elements to the symbol. From there, I added elements to the game piece-by-piece, such as the timer feature, fake elements, fun DOM manipulation, an option to play in Spanish, and ultimately a second player.

Ultimately, the most difficult aspect for me was

### Unsolved Problems
- Still working on some Firefox & Safari styling issues (mostly animations).
- The game works on mobile, but I would like to make mobile styling better.
- I would like to refactor so fake elements show up more often as the selected element.
