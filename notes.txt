USING SCIENCE TO ANGER THE UNJUST RULER WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN SCIENCE

Trivia game on the Periodic Table of Elements. Two player game. Fastest time wins.

Random periodic element names will display on the screen and the player must type in the answer for the periodic table symbol.

-- If the answer is correct, the anger level of the unjust ruler will rise.
-- If the answer is incorrect, the anger level of the unjust ruler will lower.

The player's time is recorded until the angry ruler reaches max angriness (aka 15 points - each correct answer worth one point).

If a player chooses to play in Spanish - which angers the unjust ruler even more - each correct answer is worth 1.5 points. The element names will be displayed in Spanish.

Whichever player angers the ruler the fastest wins the game.
